## Overview
ButtScape allows RuneScape to connect to Intiface, enabling synchronization between in-game XP drops and compatible intimacy devices. Currently, it sends a 0.5 second vibration when a user-inputted EXP threshold is dropped.

## Usage

1. Launch Intiface and ensure it is running.

2. Open the ButtScape plugin panel in RuneLite.

3. Set your preferred XP threshold and vibration intensity.

4. Enter the WebSocket server address (default: ws://localhost:12345).

5. Click Connect to Intiface.

6. Enjoy synchronized feedback based on your in-game experience gains!
